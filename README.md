## Introduction
This project was a 1 week spring where our team completed a MVP for our client L. Derely. 
*Add any additional content here pertaining to the timeline, any personal goals, etc.*

## What does the app do?
Our client wanted to create a video platform specificly for our older generation to share their wisdom and experiences. 
Taking into account our target users, accessability for those users, and our time frame, we created exactly that. 
Users are able create profiles through google authentication, upload videos and blogs, favorite other creators and receive notifications when those creators upload, vote on video categories, and more!
